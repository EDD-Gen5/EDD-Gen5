# EDD-Gen5  
**Electromagnetic Differential Drive Generator, Version 5**

## About  
EDD-Gen5 is a **non-profit, open-source science experiment**, combining human ingenuity with AI support,  
to explore whether electromagnetic, mechanical, and momentum principles can be harnessed in a practical generator —  
for the knowledge and potential benefit of all.

This repository currently serves as a **placeholder** and will later host:  
- Research notes and documentation  
- CAD designs and schematics  
- Source code for control systems  
- Experimental data and results  

## Project Identity  
**Tagline:**  
*A Science Experiment in Electromagnetic Drive*  
**Compact form (for references):**  
`EDD-Gen5 — A Science Experiment in Electromagnetic Drive, with AI Collaboration`  

## Current Status
