# CAD Assembly Matrix Generator  

This tool parses a FreeCAD assembly tree (exported as a `.txt` file) and converts it into a spreadsheet format (`.xlsx` or `.ods`).  
It was developed to assist with managing complex assemblies by generating structured part matrices.

   - Example: `tree_19Jan2025.txt`  
2. Run the script with:  

   ```bash
   python make_assembly_matrix.py tree_19Jan2025.txt
