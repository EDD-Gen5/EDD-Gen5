# EDD-Gen5  
**Electromagnetic Differential Drive Generator, Version 5**

---

## About  
EDD-Gen5 is a **non-profit, open-source science experiment**, combining human ingenuity with AI support,  
to explore whether electromagnetic, mechanical, and momentum principles can be harnessed in a practical generator —  
for the knowledge and potential benefit of all.

This repository currently serves as a **placeholder** and will later host:  
- Research notes and documentation  
- CAD designs and schematics  
- Source code for control systems  
- Experimental data and results

## Available Tools  
This repository already includes a general-purpose utility:  

### CAD Assembly Matrix Generator  
A Python tool that converts a FreeCAD assembly tree (exported as a `.txt` file)  
into a structured spreadsheet (`.xlsx` or `.ods`) showing direct children and rollup parts views.  
Location: [`/Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/`](Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/)  

### CAD Simple Fits Calculator
A tiny Tkinter desktop app that lets you easily calculate required fits, by selecting types and entering dimensions (mm).  
Location: [`/simple_fits_picker/`](simple_fits_picker/)
