# EDD-Gen5  
**Electromagnetic Differential Drive Generator, Version 5**

## About  
EDD-Gen5 is a **non-profit, open-source science experiment**, combining human ingenuity with AI support,  
to explore whether electromagnetic, mechanical, and momentum principles can be harnessed in a practical generator —  
for the knowledge and potential benefit of all.

This repository currently serves as a **placeholder** and will later host:  
- Research notes and documentation  
- CAD designs and schematics  
- Source code for control systems  
- Experimental data and results  

## Project Identity  
**Tagline:**  
*A Science Experiment in Electromagnetic Drive*  
**Compact form (for references):**  
`EDD-Gen5 — A Science Experiment in Electromagnetic Drive, with AI Collaboration`  

## Current Status  
 **Early setup stage — content to be added.**  

## Available Tools  
This repository already includes a general-purpose utility:  

### CAD Assembly Matrix Generator  
Location: [`/Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/`](Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/)  

A Python tool that converts a FreeCAD assembly tree (exported as a `.txt` file)  
into a structured spreadsheet (`.xlsx` or `.ods`) showing direct children and rollup parts views.  

This script is not project-specific and may be useful to anyone working with FreeCAD assemblies.  
See the [tool’s README](Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/README.md) for usage instructions.
