## Available Tools  

This repository already includes a general-purpose utility:  

### CAD Assembly Matrix Generator  
Location: [`/Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/`](Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/)  

A Python tool that converts a FreeCAD assembly tree (exported as a `.txt` file)  
into a structured spreadsheet (`.xlsx` or `.ods`) showing direct children and rollup parts views.  

This script is not project-specific and may be useful to anyone working with FreeCAD assemblies.  
See the [toolâ€™s README](Tools/cad_assembly_matrix_generator/README.md) for usage instructions.
