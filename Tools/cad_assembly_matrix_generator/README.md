# CAD Assembly Matrix Generator  

This tool parses a FreeCAD assembly tree (exported as a `.txt` file) and converts it into a spreadsheet format (`.xlsx` or `.ods`).  
It was developed to assist with managing complex assemblies by generating structured part matrices.  

---

## Usage  

1. Export your FreeCAD assembly tree into a `.txt` file.  
   - Example: `tree_19Jan2025.txt`  
2. Run the script with:  

   ```bash
   python make_assembly_matrix.py tree_19Jan2025.txt
